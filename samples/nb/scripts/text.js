var sensory_cortex_text = "<p align='center' style='color:red'><em>The sensory cortex registers sensation from the entire body.</em></p> The summer of fire and fury, the year the Doomsday Clock moves thirty seconds closer to midnight, you can tell us the exact temperature of hell. In the hospital lounge I reassure Hanna the CNN news feed is all just bluster talk—the monotone talking heads mansplaining diagrams of US and North Korean nuclear missiles. In this oppressive atmosphere who can think straight? The stale hospital air tastes like the inside of a freezer, and I can’t help wondering if you’re right about the end times. Maybe what is exploding in your brain, images of heat and flame and charred remains outside your window is yours to know and ours to find out. I’m up early to avoid the heat—as early as four some mornings, camped out at Mom’s with the kids to be closer to you. I fire up my laptop in the basement, getting in two hours of work before Mom is up at 6 and off to the hospital by 8. I am not only OK, I’m incredibly OK—not like other humans who need sleep to function. Work is helping me. I need something to focus on. I honestly don’t feel tired. The truth is, I don’t feel anything since Mom told me you tried to kill yourself. It is strange, this heart pumping, energy-fuelled state of unfeeling. I can feel my heart beating too fast all the time but don’t feel pain or joy or anything else. By the end of the summer I stop believing in impermanence. This is the new normal-you exist on the third floor and Mom lives alone in the house, where I live, too, on alternate weeks, world without end, Amen. This thing that has gripped you, made your eyes fearful and your body slow, is a force turning all of us into zombies. Mid-October, seven months after the first dark vision, I cry. Another death in the family, the third this year, and whatever is squeezing my heart too tight, by the end of that phone call, gently releases. When you show signs of getting well in time for Christmas I come apart entirely. No longer need to be vigilant, to keep up the vigil. Exhaustion forces me to learn a new way of being. To move toward the pain rather than resist it. To sit patiently, the way I did with you in pain."

var frontal_lobe_text = "<p align='center' style='color:red'><em>The frontal lobe is critical for higher level thinking, judgement, and decision making.</em></p>Ash Wednesday was when it all started—the first vision of the Virgin Mary in your bedroom, unspeakably terrible, the weight of having seen yours alone to bear. The details a secret you can’t tell because if you do, it will destroy the world. It’s a punishment, this vision, for some unforgiveable thing you’ve done. “Change your name,” you tell us. “It’ll be on CNN, they’ll say I’m worse than Hitler.” “He’s locked in” Kevin said after he found you on the couch, hands in your lap, staring at the wall. For months you are fixated on whatever you’ve seen, your impending death and certain doom. The incongruity of who you’ve become, overnight, with who you’ve always been, feels like a science fiction plot—your frontal lobe hijacked by a microchip implant programmed to fix the mind on its most frightening thought. The weekend before you’re re-admitted you agree to sit outside with us on the balcony; it was early evening, the temperature cooling, the deck umbrella tilted for shade. You set a tall glass of water on the seat of your walker, then shuffle across the floor toward us. We held our breath, watching, wondering if you’d make it. But you misjudged your own strength and steadiness, your ability to lift the walker over the threshold to the deck. Before we could save you, from embarrassment, from the glass tipping, your walker wheel bumped into the ledge. You shook your head, hobbled back to bed as Mom swept and I picked up the broken glass. You start to topple, too. When you sit up in your bed, your blood pressure drops, making you dizzy. You fall in the hospital bathroom; I imagine the trapped air toxic, thick with the sick smell of lemon-pine. The secret pushes you toward a way out—or maybe the microchip is programmed with final instructions: blunt trauma to the temple. You close the bathroom door, bend, and bang your head against the sink, over and over again. When Mom notices the angry red mark over your eye you shake your head, say, “I don’t know why I did that. What I was thinking.” Months after the doctors remove the chip—a matter of the right cocktail—your judgement is slowly restored. You’re left with some anxiety, about hospital bills, about running out of money. I’ll start practicing non-judgement. To learn to be an impartial witness to life. A way, I hope, to rewire my burned out brain.";

var brain_stem_text = "<p align='center'><span style='color:red'><em>The brain stem controls vital involuntary functions: breathing, heart rate, consciousness.</span></em></p> A blood red orb glows in the sky. Apocalyptic. <em>Wildfires rage across the province.</em> I make the three hour drive home, windows rolled up. Still, ash coats my tongue. Months before the smog, you wheeze, unable to take a full breath. <em>Mild COPD</em> a doctor notes in your chart—the least of your worries. <em>Emphesema</em>, you tell us in a voice rehearsed for a radio play. In your twenties you began a half pack a day habit that spanned twenty years. I smoked for a few years in my twenties, too. DuMaurier lights—weed just a handful of times. The inside of my brain was scary, then—why make things scarier with drugs? One night the year I was deciding to stay or go, my friend, the musician came over. When the evening dissolved, blue to black, we walked to the park. He lit a joint, held it under a rolled up a real estate guide. <em>Breathe</em>, he said, and I did, fast and deep. But the lit tip was loose and embers hit the back of my throat. A hot spark lodged in my lung. I bent over, coughing; he rubbed my back, deadpanned disappointment: <em>Sure, take it all</em>. The thought of a sick girl like me greedy for something she could take or leave? It hurt to breathe and it hurt to laugh but once I started, I couldn’t stop. I don’t have many memories from that time but I remember warmth coiling up my legs like a vine that night as we passed the Hell’s Angels on the way home, cool night air licking my face and hands—a kitten’s tongue. Chilled champagne in round bowled wine glasses. <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> on mute and <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> spinning, all the lights out. The end of a long numb winter when the future was hazy and grey. Once I could breathe again I <em>did</em> want to take it all. I don’t know what you’ll remember about this year—if you’ll laugh again, or if you’ll live. But when I pull into the driveway and let the kids loose and wander the backyard, the blackberries are what I notice and what I wish you could see. Branches bulging with clusters of fruit. I pick one—purple’s darkest shade, almost black—then another. One berry, one breath, until I fill an entire bucket. Remember, Dad, to feel each one between your fingers. To not <em>not-feel</em> the prick of thorns."

var brocas_area_text = "<p align='center'><span style='color:red'><em>Broca’s Area is a region in the frontal lobe linked to speech production.</em><span></p> I tell Mom <em>I can’t talk to anyone about Dad right now.</em> Cathy emails to ask “What’s the news?” and my brain hurts trying to type a response. How to update your niece without causing alarm while still being honest? I reply with an angle, one aspect of truth—<em>Still waiting for test results</em>. I won’t say that Mom can’t be in the room with you for more than forty minutes now. It’s gone on for months—your grim, ceaseless rants about dying, what’s in store for your doomed soul. A priest visits the hospital to take your confession—Mom’s been told not to argue with you, and this is her idea. Playing along, also hoping you’ll accept forgiveness. That it might offer relief—be the thing that unlocks your mind when nothing else can. You smirk when Father David arrives with a friendly smile and holds your hand in his. You’re playing along, too. No holy man can overcome the evil you embody. Your eyes are either blank or dead certain. Sometimes they soften when we visit, unbelieving at first. Amazed we could have survived the Apocalypse you see unfolding outside through the window. The knowing smirk returns. “You look like my family,” you say, “but it’s not really you, is it.” When I was a teenager, I wanted to know what you thought about God, if you believed in heaven. I liked imagining you as an altar boy, belted, floor-skimming white robe, solemn as you held the chalice in your small hands. All my life, you were a Sunday morning bench warmer, eyes closed, head bowed, breath relaxed—contemplating the mystery of the Holy Trinity, the Virgin Birth, our salvation, or just napping, I always thought. You went to church each Sunday because Mom wanted us all to go, because you grew up attending mass, and maybe, as a kind of spiritual insurance policy. At All Saint’s the priest ranted on subjects you were silent about—abortion, the scourge of secular feminists. <em>Do this in memory of me</em> was your cue, the ringing of the altar bells rousing you in time for Communion. The sound signifying a supernatural change: the transubstantiation of the host into the bread of life, wine into blood, our spiritual drink. You didn’t want me to think so much about dying then. <em>You only have to do it once—why die a thousand times by worrying about it?</em> You always said, <em>God is much nicer than I am, and I’d never send anyone to Hell</em>."

var cerebellum_text="<p align='center' style='color:red'><em>The cerebellum is responsible for balance, coordination, and voluntary movement.</em></p> Backyard warrior. Rooftop retriever of birdees and frisbees. Pole swinging enemy of rats and hornets. Scaler of fences to retrieve my first lost tooth, spat from a peach. Dad-sharp reflexes, one quick hand, you saved Kevin’s life, grasping the back of his shirt and pulling him back in through the second storey window. I hated it when you climbed any ladder, or worse, walked along the roof. You might have crazy glued your fingers together, slammed the car hood shut on your glasses and called yourself a sausage–your preferred insult for idiots–but you never lost your balance. When I was small my favourite book was “Freddie’s Fix-It-Box”, a gift from you. I started calling you “Mr. Fix It” because repairs and maintenance, making things work, was what you did. Sixteen, I pointed at you–whistling as you climbed the stairs in a green shirt and brown pants, solid and smelling of cut grass, sweat and juniper–and joked to my friend, “My dad’s a tree.” Logging camp accountant and first aid man–first on the scene when anyone was hurt. Untold, the impact of being responsible for care when a worker bled out, scared, dying; it happened twice. Difficulty with balance is to be expected, the doctor tells us; for every week you lay in bed, expect three to regain lost muscle tone. It’s a shock to see you; tiny frame and more frail, down 60 lbs. In summer we’d swim in the pool you built, swing on the swingset you constructed, drive the go-kart made from my old tricycle, repurposed dining room chair, scrap wood. This summer, family holidays are cancelled, but I take the kids swimming every day–we escape the oppressive sun, the heat inside Mom’s house, try to have a few hours of fun. Back at school in the fall, Noam’s teacher asks the class to draw a picture of what they did over the summer. Three circle heads bob, bodies hidden under the surface of the water; a clutch of sadness, grief, grips my guts when I see it. The three of us, dog paddling, alone in a pool, just trying to stay afloat. Countless specialists examine you–geriatric, internal medicine, psychologists–but what tipped you off balance remains inconclusive. Balance, coordination, in time of crisis–I stop working. “It’s not about me and what I want right now,” I say whenever I have to tell someone no. Day to day, your illness is teaching me what matters; everything I thought I needed that I can actually let go."

var occipital_lobe_text="<p align='center' style='color:red'><em>The occipital lobe is responsible for processing visual information.</em></p> A white heart glows; yellow rays radiate beyond the page. A visualization tool found via image search for “love and golden light” to overpower red fire, subsume orange flames. Mom tapes the picture to your bedroom mirror next to drawings from the kids–the first thing you’ll see when you awake. In August, cousins visit; wildfire season and even at sunset it’s too hot to sit inside. We sip lemonade on the balcony; pretend it’s fine that you sleep all day, say hello, then shuffle back to bed. Insane to bake in this heat, but in the air conditioned store I bought the sugar cookie kit, promised the kids. Beads of sweat form on our brows, upper lips, as we roll out the dough in the early evening, cut twelve perfect circles. Mix icing the colour of yellow plastic and fake red smiles. A dozen emoji cookies grin at us from the plate, their eyes shaped like hearts or empty black dots. That shade of yellow reminds me of skies surrounding a white hot sun in a Van Gogh landscape. Was it you who told me he ate yellow paint to try to feel happy again? Before we serve the cousins I snap a picture on my phone to show you later. Impossible that the baker of birthday cakes, spritz cookies, and apple kuchen won’t eat soon. We trace our steps backwards, to try to recognize the moment of change. Were you sad at Christmas—more sad than would be expected at Gina’s funeral? Or did it start earlier, at your 80th birthday party? Mom keeps seeing you at the end of the night, sitting alone at a table in your party hat, as guests left and we cleaned up the hall. When did a visit with you become a sitting meditation? This hyper focus on objects that are real. I look at a plain white cup beside the sink, the half-circle of coffee ringed beneath it for a long time; when you’re re-admitted, observe a ridged plastic cup of orange juice, the striped straw pushed through the foil lid. Until they remove it from your hand, I stare at the ring you’ve worn faithfully on your right hand as long as I’ve known you. Your wedding gift from mom—10 karat gold, the ruby square cut. What would you be hallucinating if in childhood you’d never seen an image of hellfire–if there were only healing hearts when you died, golden halos, bright, open skies?"

var temporal_lobe_text="<p align='center' style='color:red'><em>The temporal lobe is involved in processing auditory information, hearing and selective listening.</em></p> What’s most strange? The absence of sound. A man who always hummed, whistled or sang, then ranted for weeks, now silent. Your ears attuned to the subtle; noises we can’t hear. Water drips from the ceiling. Then, when you open your eyes, you see the waterfall gushing, a curtain around your bed. Delirium, the doctor tells us. But you’ll stay on the third floor. There are younger, stronger, sicker people than you in psych. Too dangerous for an 80 year old. And the tubes; they won’t admit you there anyway because tubes pose a risk of self-harm. The week you tell us you tried to kill yourself I tell the hospitalist. “My dad might not be as honest with you as he is with us about what he’s thinking.” But he counters, point of fact, “This morning your dad told me about his suicidal ideation.” I can’t be hearing correctly. He repeats it for me. “Don’t worry. We hope to have him home by Friday.” When I think home, I think: stairs, knives, pills. I ask questions; the nurses answer. Discharge plans are in place. He’ll be happier at home. The patient care coordinator tells me: Your mom can take care of him. Why doesn’t she want to look after her own husband? I dial into a family meeting from where I live, 100 km away. Hear my voice, clear and steady, ask the room “Is it your professional opinion that it’s safe for my dad to go home—given how recently he tried to harm himself?” White noise, a hum on the line, as I read aloud at- risk traits for suicide–six for six. “How do I talk to my dad now? I don’t know how to reach him anymore.” No one can say. The phone buzzes, day and night. At Sarah’s I jolt when the landline rings, spring off the couch—it can’t be for me, but vigilance is involuntary. A ringing phone, a doctor’s call back. Another emergency. At your bedside I ask if you’d like me to read to you. You shrug. There’s nothing you want, it’s too much effort to say no. But you like Brian Doyle’s stories–the mysterious bolt of light he witnesses in the early hours of an Easter vigil. Everyone sees what he sees, but no one says a word. The moment is silent, sacred. Your blue eyes, soft. A gentle look that might be hope. I read another, and then another. I’m still here. You can still hear me."

var artist_statement_text = "<span style='color:red'><strong>About this Interactive Essay</strong></span><br/><br/>The summer of 2017 was the summer of <em>fire and fury</em> – of aggressive nuclear threats, raging wildfires that made the sun burn red in the sky, and without a TV or window to observe the world from his hospital room, the unfolding of a fiery apocalypse that only my dad could see.<br/><br/><em>Mind Map</em> is an attempt to grapple with the psychotic episode that overpowered my father for half a year and overshadowed the lives of my family. Although addressed to my dad, I don’t intend to share <em>Mind Map</em> with him. I do wonder if he remembers what he saw, but I’d prefer he didn’t.<br/><br/> Although I wrote it for my father, I made this interactive essay for myself, as an unburdening. I also made it as a way to honour the fact that we somehow survived--a terrifying psychosis, the world spinning crazier and more increasingly chaotic and violent--and what might be real, imagined or manufactured a harder line to draw.<br/><br/> I share <em>Mind Map</em> because mental illness in older adults is extremely common. It seems like sharing may be the best possible thing to do with a story that, kept a secret, can leave other families feeling alone and isolated.<br/><br/> The reality is 23% of older adults will experience a psychotic episode. According to CASP (Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention) seniors are one of the most at risk demographics when it comes to suicide, and men over the age of 65+ are the most at risk.<br/><br/> Although the idea for this essay was mine, this piece is a collaboration. All the visuals and behind-the-scenes interactive magic are the work of digital artist and friend, Bill Pickard (<a href='https:/www.billrpickard.com' target='_blank'>www.billrpickard.com</a>). The background illustration was painted by 19th century Spanish neuroscientist, Santiago Ramón y Cajal.
