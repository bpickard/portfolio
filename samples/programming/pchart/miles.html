		<h3><u>Genetic Counseling Exercise A : Pedigree construction and probability calculation</u></h3>
		

		<p>Miles and Julia have been married for 3 years and are thinking of starting a family. But they want to talk to a genetic counselor to help them determine their risks of having a child with a serious illness. Miles and Julia met because of a genetic illness – hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is a serious illness in which the blood of an affected person will not clot correctly due to a lack of functional clotting factor VIII. Even minor cuts and injuries can be serious because these people bleed very heavily. In the past, hemophilia was a kind of death sentence because no treatments existed but now, patients with hemophilia A can be treated by regular injection with clotting factor. Neither Miles nor Julia has hemophilia A, but each has a brother with it. Now that they are considering having children, they are understandably concerned about the chances that one of their children might be affected with this serious disease.</p>

		<p>A genetic counselor will first take a family history – find out as much as possible about the family members in order to estimate as accurately as possible the odds of having a child affected by these disorders. In this exercise you will act as the genetic counselor, looking at the family information, making a pedigree for Miles and Julia and finally making some probability calculations to help them understand their risks of having a child affected with one or both of the disorders they are worried about.</p>

		<h3><u>Miles</u></h3>
		<h3>Task: Complete the pedigree chart for Miles' family</h3>
		<p>Use fully shaded figures for individuals with hemophilia: <img src="circle.png" align="absmiddle"><img src="square.png" align="absmiddle">
		<p>Remember that squares indicate male family members and circles indicate female family members.</p>
		
		
		<b><u>Instructions</u></b>
		<p>Click on the question marks multiple times to cycle through the symbols. Drag the family members from below to the space below their appropriate symbols.</p>
		<p><font color="red"><B>IMPORTANT:</B> Complete the chart by going down the family tree from left to right in the order the people appear in the family history. For this exercise there is only one correct way the chart can be filled out.</font></p>
		
		<h3><u>Family History</u></h3>
		<p>Well, my maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather were both normal; neither had hemophilia. One of my uncles, Rex has hemophilia. Uncle Rex is unmarried. Uncle Paul is married with one son who is normal. My Aunt Helen is married and has one son with hemophilia. My Aunt Jenny is unmarried. My mother and my father were both fine, no hemophilia. My eldest sister is fine, but my brother Dylan has hemophilia. My younger sister is fine too.</p>

My mother is fine and my father is normal as well. He was an only child and both his parents are deceased. We don't know anything about the health of my paternal grandparent's siblings.
